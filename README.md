# fed-band-project

This project creates a static (front-end only) website for a band to promote their back catalog, and 
any new material as it becomes available to existing and new fans. The site showcases their music and publicises 
their availability to perform live, at events such as weddings and Christmas parties. Forms are provided to 
facilitate booking of the band and to request additional information on the band's status, gigs or merchandise. Links 
are provided to their social media pages; Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
## UX: ##
### Strategy: ###
In relation to  the strategy, all assets supplied, which provide the content, are useful in targeting a variety of 
users. Thus the  target group is all music lovers which includes both business and general consumer. From a
consumer perspective the site is presented in such a way as to primarily target new fans as existing fans are well 
familiar with the brand. From a business perspective there is a desire and potential to attract music promoters and 
corporate businesses to hire the band for events. The music industry has adapted very well to digital technology and 
thus there are no technological issues envisaged. The business goal is also quite straightforward. Promote the 
brand while maintaining  the existing fan base and developing a new one. With the younger generation being reared on 
internet and mobile phone technology, establishing new fans is a mere click away, particularly as the site will 
feature iconic tunes and images that appeal to emotions. The primary consideration is simple content both catchy and 
compelling for potential fans with underlying content to entice business users and keep existing fans updated.
#### User stories include: ####
* As a fan I want to quickly sample music with a view to purchase 
* As a fan I want to click a button to find recent information on my band 
* As a promoter I want to quickly check availability of bands for hire
* As a band we want to use modern technology to promote ourselves on a global level to open up new markets

### Scope: ###
AS outlined above simple content using iconic images and tunes is preferred to avoid scope creep and to focus the 
user. The desire is to make the decision for them. The content is mixed and uses text, images and video and audio 
files. Elements are sized to inform and entice.
### Structure: ###
The intention is to create meaningful relationships as the user navigates the site. Main navigation elements are 
provided conventionally (horizontally close to the top of the page) and remain consistent throughout in form and 
function. They allow allows users to efficiently move through content. Familiarity is induced by keeping styles 
stable and consistent. Information is grouped into familar categories and in general fits the page with minimal 
scrolling. Large single click objects that perform  a colour change on action inform the user as to what is going 
on and information is provided in a clear assured manner. There are no dead links. Where links are not established 
yet  the user is directed to a new tab page with a message. The simple minimalistic page structure facilitates a 
mobile first approach while ensuring there is scope for growth and change to allow the site to evolve as more 
content becomes available.
### Skeleton: ###
The users navigate through the site through navigation menus, links and buttons. Navigation remains familiar 
throughout  to cultivate familiarity and to promote a positive user friendly experience. Specific content is 
further built on through the specific link and progressive disclosure in conjunction with similar expression of 
similar parts, ensures consistent perception throughout the site. Order is preserved. The information is revealed 
across a number of pages through the use of simple features and minimal clicks. Navigation is enhanced through the 
use of representational icons that are conventional and visible.  Being familiar objects they are easily understood 
and provide clear meaning to all users. Similar icons on different pages induce the same positive user experience. 
Pencil wireframe was used to plot a two-dimensional model of the perceived end product. These static diagrams 
represented the content, navigations and interactions in a meaningful visual format. The wireframes are included 
with the project and located in the additional_info folder in the assets directory.
### Surface: ###
The surface pulls together layout, typography, colors, images, fonts and reveals the order and sequence of the 
site. The consistency of the patterns are recognised as are the contrast in fonts, sizes and colours. 5 pages are 
provided along with two additional pdfs that open in a new tab. The clients, being entertainers have influenced the 
choice of layout and colors. An artistic look has been created through a minimalistic approach with light background 
colours and contrasting reddish font colours and some black text. It is inspired from the bands previous incarnation 
as comic book characters in the late sixties.  The brand image chosen is one of their comic book images and thus 
sets the tone for the whole product. The features and elements float in space and are defined by their very presence 
in this space. The user is drawn to the feature floating in space.  
The mimialistic approach and simplicity of features ensures that the user is not overloaded and distracted from the 
purpose of the product, which is to disseminate information on the band and raise their profile. In addition it 
allows scope for addition of information within the current structure, when more information becomes available, if 
so desired. The rule of thirds is evident with the structure of header, section and footer roughly taking up a third 
of the height respectively.  The iconic logo is placed in the top left third of the header. Clicking on this logo 
will always take you to the home page, which is an accepted convention. Transisitions have been kept to a minimum. 
A simple transisition has been applied to the logo image, using a hover effect which has been further enhanced by 
applying some further css styling. The image comes toward you to greet you on hover and it is complemented by the 
slogan taking up the two thirds header space to the right. The header slogan is a direct quote from the signature 
tune of the band. This is the first element of the branding to introduce the band.   
The navigation menu always sits in the bottom two thirds of the header section across the whole product. There is 
a simple pulse animation on each item in the menu representing  beats of musical notes in keeping with the artistic 
theme. There is also a conventional icon for each item as well as a colour change on hover indicating that an action 
(click) can occur. The navigation menu while consistent in appearance does have a subtle change to the content 
across each page. For example when in the about page, a menu link to this page is not necessary, so the about link 
is changed with a link to the gallery page and so on. This means that all pages are accessible from the current page 
with just one click.   
The header section is consistent across all pages in form with the footer consistent across the first three pages. 
Some familiarity of the footer is retained for the final two pages. The footer contains two call to actions. A 
button to inquire on hiring  and a button to receive information on the band and products. These buttons are 
actually links disguised as buttons and are identical to the submit buttons on the contact page. The links to social 
media are also contained in the footer.  Again all buttons and links remain familiar across the site in form colour 
and function. The one exception is in the contact page where visually, the social links are changed to match the 
form of the navigation menu. The icons and text still clearly define the intent and thus the function has not 
changed. This change works well in the contact page where more footer space permits use of larger type elements 
that entice the user to click and discover more. It sits horizontally as normal on mobile type devices but with the 
use of a media query, floats vertically in space like a sidebar, on larger screen sizes.  
The mid section of the home page is subtely darkened to reveal a separate section, being the second third in a 
horizontal context. A video of one of their best sellers sits in the left third of the section beneath the logo-image. 
This is complemented further right by a branding message, including a second line from their signature song. Finally 
in this mid section, two buttons invite the user to sample some tunes and view some images. These custom buttons are 
actually links but  the use of a button class allows better styling to give more definition and to blend in with the 
theme. This completes the branding aspect of the band.  
The About page is very similar to the home page with the exception of the middle section which now contains some 
information about the band. A publicity image of the band  replaces the video with information on the band to the 
right. A link to view the gallery is provided below the image. Again the mid section of the About page is subtely 
darkened to define a separate section. A download icon with instructions facilitates a link to a wikipedia file with 
more information about the band, which, includes history, discography and bibliography.  
The Songs page is also very similar to the home page with the exception of the middle section, now dominated by the 
available audio tracks which fill the entire mid section. The audio control bar fits under a large album image. There 
is little distraction here, just click and listen.  
The contact page keeps the same header section as the previous pages. The mid section is taken up by a publicity 
image occupying the first third and the available for hire form which takes up the remaining two thirds to the right. 
There is no footer on this page. The section is continued with the request for information form in the first two 
thirds and the social links bar in the last third.  
The gallery page maintains the same consistent header, with a carousel slide show occupying the mid section of the page.  It also contains the normal footer including the social links menu.
## Features: ##
This application comprises several features.
 
### Existing Features: ###
- Feature 1 -  The brand image logo in the header section enlarges (using hover.css) as if greeting the user (as 
described in UX above) while also allowing the user to redirect to the home page when clicked.  
- Feature 2 - The nav bar elements pulsate imitating a musical beat (as described in UX above).  
- Feature 3 - A video player on the home page allows the user to watch a nusical video of the band on click._
The basic html video player is used and is sufficient for current purposes, as no javascript is used at this stage. 
The control bar allows for play, pause, volume adjustment and enlargement to full screen size.  
- Feature 4 - Buttons on the home page provide links to audio tunes and the gallery. All a user needs to do is click.  
- Feature 5 - The footer section of the site provides a link to the booking form on the contact page, where the user 
can fill in details, to send a booking request to the band (note: this is a front end only project; so no validation 
is provided, as the form is not posted to a backend server. Also see **Note** below)  
- Feature 6 - The footer section of the site provides a link to a request for information form on the contact page, 
where the user can fill in details, to send an information request to the band (note: this is a front end only 
project; so no validation is provided, as the form is not posted to a backend server. Also see **Note** below).  
**Note** For the forms basic textarea forms are used where the user enters name, email and information required. A 
link name is added to the contact page at the request info section, to ensure that when the information button in 
the footer is clicked, the user arrives at the information form rather than the top of the page. (note: as this is 
a front end development only project, the submit buttons on the forms are currently redundant).  
- Feature 7 - The footer provides clickable links to the social media sites facebook, twitter and youtube. Again these 
links are not wired up so they take you to an information page (Watch this Space!).  
- Feature 8 - A download link in the about page allows the user to download more information on the band.  
- Feature 9 - There is an additional link button to the gallery provided under the promotional image on the about page.  
- Feature 10 - An html audio player facilitates the playing of tunes on the songs page.
Four equal bootstrap columns contain the available audio tracks in the audio page. The basic html audio player is 
used and the controls allow for play, pause and volume adjustment. 
- Feature 11 - A bootstrap 4 carousel is used to present band images. It contains both indicator links and prev, next links.

### Features Left to Implement ###
- The project in its current state presents a front end web application designed and implemented as described in the 
preceeding paragraphs. As the site develops and grows javascript would need to be introduced to enhance the elements. 
One limitation at present is that the current audio continues to play when the next one is clicked. Thus it 
needs to be paused before playing another. This can be addressed later on with the introduction of javascript as 
the site develops and expands. More complex media players could be constructed to enhance the experience of finding 
and playing tracks on the site.

- Backend frameworks would need to be introduced so that forms and social media links are not redundant. In this 
instance both frontend and server end validation would need to be developed and introduced.
As demand and interest increases the site could be expanded to include an online newsletter, blog page, 
shopping page, etc.

## Technologies Uesd ##
HTML and CSS have been used to produce this application. Some javascript has been employed to trigger the slides in the carousel. The links 
underlined below list the technologies used to build and enhance this application.  
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)  
    - Used as the main responsive design framework. Bootstrap 4 is used for the carousel and is applied to all elements on that page.
- [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  
     - Icons used in nav bar, social media section and as button links.  
- [hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)  
    - Used to enhance the logo and nav bar elements.  
- [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  
    - Indie+flower, Roboto and Exo font styles used.  
- [flexbox](https://cssreference.io/flexbox/)   
    - Some flexbox layout has also been used where appropriate. 
 
- Bootstrap and flexbox easily cater for a design responsive approach where the emphasis is designing for a mobile 
first approach. Many elements have been repeated meaning that blocks of code can be reused resulting in efficiencies 
in coding and development.    
- Semantic elements such as (form), (button), (article), (header) and (section) are used throughout to enable 
content to be better defined. In addition class names are applied extensively to further define elements and 
facilitate style targetting. The span element while non-semantic is used on a few occasions to help style target 
an inline item.    
- Comments are also used within the html and css pages to further signify what elements are involved.  
- The bootstrap grid system is used for most of the site facilitating a mobile first approach. Rows are placed within 
a full width container (container-fluid) to facilitate proper alignment and padding. The rows also enable the 
creation of horizontal groups of columns and this is useful when designing layout to the rule of  thirds. Some 
typography from bootstrap is  employed such as (mark), text-uppercase and text-center. The list-inline class is 
used to list the navigation menu items and the social media links. Clearfix is used in conjunction with inline 
elements to clear any potentially floated content.  
- The bootstrap img-responsive class is used for the image in the header and the images on the about and contact pages.  
This minimises the need for styling of these images. The img-circle class was used in the gallery to give a portrait 
look to the individual band member images.  
- Other properties such as max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; and center-block are all used to centrally 
position other images and blocks of media files and text.  
- The button classes btn-success and  btn-info are used in conjunction with the forms (enquire about hiring and request 
info respectively), representing conventional colours that are recognisable. A btn-custom class is used for the 
links on the home page, so they can be styled in the general theme of the site.  A btn-sm class is used for the link 
to the gallery. This button class facilitates a block of colour on hover.  
- The flexbox grid system is used for the mid section of the about page. Flexbox easily fits between two bootstrap 
grid sections and minimises the amount of code needed to achieve the required layout. Elements are easily styled 
with the flex property and responsive design is achieved by using the flex-wrap property.  
- A simple flex grid layout is used for the gallery section layout.  The images are used as provided and the use of 
the justify-content align-center properties, allows a neat layout regardless of size. When future images become 
available the order property can be used to display them first, if so desired. (note: Jscript has not been used on 
this project at this stage, so a sldeshow feature has not yet been considered).   
- The bootstrap grid system is used for the header and footer layouts.   
- Two columns of one third and two thirds cater for an image and booking form, respectively in the mid section of the        
contact page. 
- The footer holds the information form and social links bar in this same page.
- Bootstrap 4 is employed on the gallery page to facilitate the use of a carousel slide to shoe images. Bootstrap 4 is used for all elements on this page including the header and footer sections. This page is also fully mobile responsive.

## Testing ##
Testing was done by repeatedly running the code and editing until the desired outcome was achieved. The code was 
tested with chrome, firefox and microsoft edge browsers and is responsive for all 3 browsers.  
Google Developer Tools was used extensively to check layout, experiment with colours, add classes and establish 
padding and margin dimensions.  
By viewing the elements panel of DevTools individual css elements could be changed one element at a time. Styles were 
located by scrolling through the filterbox on the styles panel. Margins and paddings were experimented with to 
determine the visual layout, particularly on smaller screens. The toggle device toolbar was clicked which enabled 
various device types to be toggled through and layouts observed under the application of different style values. 
For example, on the smallest screen size, the social icons were stacking unsightly rather than staying horizontal 
as on all other screen sizes. By cycling through style values (using the up and dn keys), the padding, line heights 
and font sizes were quickly adjusted to bring the icons horizontal. Setting these dimensions on the smallest screen 
size meant that they would work across all screen sizes.  
When on a particular element, clicking on .cls enabled a new class to be added, which could then be styled. For 
example this was done for the paragraph1 class to enable these paragraphs to be styled differently than other 
paragraphs. This class and styles were then copied to the code sheets.  
The download icon was floating undesireably on smaller screen sizes and it was given a new class with associated 
styles, to separate it from the text paragraph. It was styled to always sit centrally, which works very well on all 
screen sizes.  
In another instance it was realised that the image in the about page section was not given the class of img-responsive. 
When this was added another class was required with appropriate styling to maintain a mobile first approach. The 
class added through the DevTool was called .pub-shot and it was styled to sit centrally using appropriate display 
and margin values. Clicking on the parent container and adding the wrap style to the flex-wrap property made it 
responsive on smaller screen sizes. These values were copied back to the main code.  
Through the DevTools it was picked up that css styles were targeting the image logo through the img-responsive 
class, which was now affecting all image responsive classes. Removing the img-responsive class in the style sheet 
and replacing it with a new logo-img class resolved this issue.  
New styles such as font-type, that were previously omitted when writing the main code, were also addded, by clicking 
between existing styles and adding the property and styling value. When the required style value was adopted, it was 
copied back to the code sheet.  
Existing values could also be assessed. Simply doubly clicking on a value and highlighting it, allowed it to be 
changed. Again the potential result of say for example font-size, could be viewed, by incrementally cycling through 
with the up and dn keys. What looked good was then adopted.   
Clicking on color box enabled opening of the color picker and various colour effects could be seen before selecting 
a choice. Clicking with the shift key changed the colour format.  
The computed tab in the elements panel gives an alphabetical list of properties, so specific styles could be quickly 
located for a particular element and the style sheet opened to view.
Values were then typed in and the changes instantly manifested in the main browser window, which were then either 
rejected or copied back to the main code sheet, if adopted. It was noted that by clicking show all, all values, 
including inherited values were shown.  
It was also noted that the styles tab showed all of the rules that apply to an element, including declarations that 
have been overridden, whereas the computed tab shows only the CSS that is actually being applied to an element.
Viewing the elements box model was useful to quickly look at paddings and margins. By honing in on the box model 
padding and margin settings were checked and modified if necessary. This was useful in ensuring that text or objects 
were not overflowing to the edges on small screen sizes. A value could be easily changed by double clicking on it 
and entering a value. It was useful in determining whether to set a margin or a padding.  
Clicking on hov: in the styles tab on the elements panel allowed the pseudo-class :hover,  to be toggled and colours 
viewed and finally set.  
In relation to the final version versus that initially conceived, there is little difference. Initially in the mid 
section of the home page there was one wide button, coloured cadet blue, representing a link to the songs page, 
occupying the space below the slogan. This was replaced with two buttons, a link to the tunes page and a link to 
the gallery page. Introducing the link to the gallery page means all pages can be navigated to from the home page. 
In addition the navigation menu in the header initially had the same items, but during construction, it was realised 
there was no need for a link to the page you are on, the about page for example. Thus the about link was replaced 
with a link to the gallery page and so on.  
During wireframing it was envisaged that the full existing footer would carry across all pages. When constructing 
the contact page it was realised that links to the forms were not required, being already at the forms, so only the 
social links bar is retained at the foot of the page. The form of the social links bar was changed to look like the 
navigation menu bar but sits vertically on larger screen sizes. This was done to create a feature to better fill the 
space on larger screens, rather than introduce another feature that may not blend well with a page concerned with 
the provision of information. The contact page is accessible through the navigation menu at the top. It is also more likely that users 
will access the forms after using the home, about and songs pages. The first version had a simple gallery page where the images were placed on the page. The gallery viewe is now replaced with a carousel slide.
